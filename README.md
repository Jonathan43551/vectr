# Vectr

Vectr is a next-gen OSM firmware targeting the OSMv2's accelerometer to seamlessly blend motion reactivity into your shows. It is not configurable on chip and requires a GUI that has yet t be completed for customization. As such, this is a demo version with 7 defaults meant to show off the capabilities and versatility of the Vectr platform. This is by no means a comprehensive demo of the possible modes and only serves as a teaser of what is possible.

I hope you enjoy.

## Controls

The controls for Vectr are currently very simple. Press once to change modes. Hold for half a second or more and release to put to sleep. Press once from sleep to wake up.

## Modes

### Dark Side of the Moon
This is a strobe-based mode that starts as a stroby Blink-E pattern with a white lead and a dim rainbow trail. As your motion speed increases, this trail splits off from the lead into a Strobie pattern and the rainbow strobes brighten.

### Electric Dops
This is an edge-based mode that starts as a green and purple strobie with hints of magenta and yellow at the edges. As your speed increases, it becomed more Dops-like as the edges brighten and blend to red.

### Mystic
This is a vexer-based mode that begins with a blue tracer. As your speed increased, the tracer breaks apart into a more Vex-like pattern with a turquise Dops.

### Halos
This is an edge-based mode where the edges dim and lengthen as your speed increases. The edge centers are blue with red, yellow, and green edges.

### Ghosts
This is a strobe-based mode where the blank times decrease before increasing again. When the blank times increase, the strobe time slightly shrinks. The red strobes are followed by brightening trails of green, cyan, and blue.

### Self-Healing
This is a vexer-based mode where the tracer begins as dops before merging into a solid tracer. The tracer morphs from a dim red to a dim blue during this transition.

### Sourcery
This strobe-based mode is blank when your hands are completely still. As you move your hands, thepattern quickly transitions to a Strobie before transitioning to a split hyperstrobe of the dominant blush color with an accent of magenta, purple, and royal blue.
